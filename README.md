#  Smart Crop Protection from Animals  
### AI-Based Animal Intrusion Detection using YOLO & Computer Vision

This project is an AI-powered **real-time animal intrusion detection system** designed to help farmers protect agricultural fields from crop damage. It uses **YOLO-based object detection** and **Computer Vision** techniques to identify animals entering farmland and trigger alerts for quick response.

##  Features
- Real-time animal intrusion detection  
- YOLO/CNN-based object detection  
- Works with live video feed or CCTV footage  
- Detects multiple animals (cow, goat, dog, etc.)  
- Helps reduce crop damage and increases farm safety  
- Simple and efficient AI solution for smart farming

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **YOLOv5/YOLOv8**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Torch / TensorFlow** (based on your model)  
- **Matplotlib** (optional)
